            <description><![CDATA[<p>Web Components have been an controversial subject that surfaced the Front end world over the last years that I&#39;m still pretty skeptical about its usage on existing and greenfield projects due the lack of good examples on how they can be rolled out to production, but there is sure a way to get started with them without buying in all the hype.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[There is an Element for That]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Sebastian attended to the first ever Polymer Summit in Amsterdam recently. This was his first Polymer conference obviously but this was also his first conference &amp; trip to Amsterdam. As an AngularJS developer he was very curious about the Polymer Project and the ambitious ideas behind it. Here is what he had to say.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to newer elements to play with there are a few that are slightly odd. Canvas is one of them, as it doesn’t do anything without scripting. It is a placeholder for a canvas painting or animation and can contain fallback content when it is not supported. Template is another such element that needs to be addressed in this way.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Three years ago, there was a lot of excitement surrounding Web Components: everybody talked about them, the frameworks Ember and Angular planned to integrate them or even be based on them, etc.</p>
<p>By now, that excitement seems to have died down. This blog post examines what happened to Web Components. Spoiler: they are alive and well and slowly being adopted across browsers.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Web Components are awesome for building web apps out of interoperable widgets. They’re made out of 4 technologies which
Polymer 1.0 brings to all major web browsers using polyfills. However one of them, HTML Imports, is so problematic that
Mozilla refuses to implement it natively. Let’s work around it using SystemJS and discover a whole new and (in my opinion)
nicer way of working with Polymer!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the front-end world, testing is a weird topic. Developers know how much testing is important, but lots of them don’t
embrace this practice. This is because testing is often perceived as a time consuming and a difficult task.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>There has been revived interest in standardizing shadow DOM and custom elements across all browsers. To that end we had a bunch of discussion online, met in April to discuss shadow DOM, and met earlier this month to discuss custom elements. There is agreement around shadow DOM now. <code>host.attachShadow()</code> will give you a <code>ShadowRoot</code> instance. And <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> elements can be used to populate the shadow tree with children from the host.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[</Q2-2015>]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="/articles/end-of-first-quarter-2015">past article</a>, we saw some numbers from the first quarter. That was nice because we could see exactly what was happening on each channel: <a href="/">Site</a>, <a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponents.github.io">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/web_components/">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we&#39;re not only analyzing what happened from <em>April 1, 2015</em> to <em>June 30, 2015</em>, we&#39;ll also compare those numbers with Q1 to check what we did right and what we can improve.</p>
<!-- Excerpt -->
<h2 id="site">Site</h2>
<h3 id="how-many-people-accessed-this-">How many people accessed this?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Users: 89,585 <small class="negative">⬇0.42%</small></li>
<li>Sessions: 129,518 <small class="negative">⬇2.77%</small></li>
<li>Pageviews: 233,491 <small class="negative">⬇2.36%</small></li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to the last quarter we had a slightly decrease in the number of visitors. It&#39;s nothing to worry about, specially if you see the raw numbers.</p>
<p>Our goal for next quarter is to hit 100,000 unique users. Pretty ambitious, huh?</p>
<h3 id="where-did-they-visited-from-">Where did they visited from?</h3>
<ol>
<li>United States: 34,699 (26.79%) <small class="negative">⬇2.54%</small></li>
<li>India: 7,056 (5.45%) <small class="positive">⬆20.95%</small></li>
<li>Germany: 7,038 (5.43%) <small class="positive">⬆0.49%</small></li>
<li>United Kingdom: 6,730 (5.20%) <small class="negative">⬇9.48%</small></li>
<li>Brazil: 5,758 (4.45%) <small class="positive">⬆24.34%</small></li>
</ol>
<p>By looking at our visitors we notice that UK dropped from 2nd to the 4th position. At the same time, emerging countries like India and Brazil had an impressive increase of interest.</p>
<p>We stimulate diversity and we&#39;ll keep doing that.</p>
<h3 id="what-did-they-like-to-see-">What did they like to see?</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="/">Home</a>: 102,023 (43.69%) <small class="negative">⬇3.17%</small></li>
<li><a href="/polyfills">Polyfills</a>: 27,444 (11.75%) <small class="positive">⬆5.68%</small></li>
<li><a href="/articles/introduction-to-html-imports">Introduction to HTML Imports</a>: 11,606 (4.97%) <small class="negative">⬇40.28%</small></li>
<li><a href="/articles">Articles</a>: 11,271 (4.83%) <small class="negative">⬇4.61%</small></li>
<li><a href="/presentations">Presentations</a>: 8,780 (3.76%) <small class="negative">⬇12.71%</small></li>
</ol>
<p>That <em>HTML Imports</em> article was featured in the homepage for a long time, that&#39;s why it had so many visits (besides being a great article of course). This huge decrease of visits is expected as we rotate featured articles.</p>
<p>For the next quarter, we&#39;ll try to add more articles and presentations. Those sections are crucial and we can&#39;t let them inactive.</p>
<h3 id="which-external-links-did-they-click-">Which external links did they click?</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://customelements.io/">CustomElements.io</a>: 6,210 (19.86%) <small class="positive">⬆15.53%</small></li>
<li><a href="http://builtwithpolymer.org/">Built with Polymer</a>: 3,961 (12.67%) <small class="negative">⬇0.20%</small></li>
<li><a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer</a>: 3,828 (12.24%) <small class="negative">⬇0.18%</small></li>
<li><a href="http://component.kitchen/">Component Kitchen</a>: 3,283 (10.50%) <small class="negative">⬇3.87%</small></li>
<li><a href="http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/">Custom Elements Spec</a>: 2,992 (9.57%) <small class="negative">⬇28.54%</small></li>
</ol>
<p>The <em>Specs</em> card used to be located in the top of the page, whereas the <em>Discover</em> card used to be located in the bottom. We noticed that most of the clicks were coming from this card in the bottom, so we switched them. That&#39;s why there&#39;s an increase of clicks for <em>CustomElements.io</em> and a decrease for the <em>Custom Elements Spec</em> link.</p>
<p>The homepage is a hub to other pages, we&#39;ll continue monitoring that kind of behavior and changing card positions based on what users like the most.</p>
<h2 id="github">GitHub</h2>
<h3 id="how-many-commits-we-pushed-">How many commits we pushed?</h3>
<ul>
<li>50 commits <small class="negative">⬇59.67%</small></li>
</ul>
<p>We had a tremendous decrease of commits compared to the last quarter. There are many reasons for that but I would like to highlight one which is our current stack. We use <a href="https://github.com/docpad/docpad/">DocPad</a>, a static generator in Node which is not as maintained as it used to be in the past. It is slowing us down and discouraging contributions.</p>
<p>Our goal is to move to a different Node static generator and we would love to hear your suggestions.</p>
<h3 id="who-pushed-those-commits-">Who pushed those commits?</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Nevraeka">Erik Isaksen</a>: 22 <small class="negative">⬇53.19%</small></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zenorocha">Zeno Rocha</a>: 20 <small class="negative">⬇68.25%</small></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mateusortiz">Matheus Ortiz</a>: 7 <small class="positive">⬆40%</small></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/PascalPrecht">Pascal Precht</a>: 1 <small class="positive">⬆100%</small></li>
</ol>
<p>Some personal reasons led me to stepping away from GitHub a little bit in the past months. But the good news is that now I&#39;m back and there&#39;s a new top contributor around: Erik Isaksen! What I can tell is that this guy has been tireless and extremely helpful.</p>
<p>For next quarter, I would like to get rid of that <em>Community</em> card in the homepage. Instead, I would like to highlight these new faces that are keeping this project active.</p>
<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>
<h3 id="how-many-tweets-were-published-">How many tweets were published?</h3>
<ul>
<li>29 tweets <small class="positive">⬆3.57%</small></li>
</ul>
<p>We published just one tweet more than we did last quarter.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a comfortable number since we try not to pollute our follower&#39;s streams so much.</p>
<h3 id="how-people-interacted-with-those-tweets-">How people interacted with those tweets?</h3>
<ul>
<li>484 retweets <small class="positive">⬆97.55%</small></li>
<li>595 favorites <small class="positive">⬆49.87%</small></li>
<li>3,200 link clicks <small class="positive">⬆88.23%</small></li>
<li>141,000 impressions <small class="positive">⬆37.69%</small></li>
</ul>
<p>What is impressive though, is that even with the same amount of tweets, we had a HUGE increase of engagement.</p>
<p>It&#39;s going to be a hard task to maintain those numbers but nothing in life is easy, right?</p>
